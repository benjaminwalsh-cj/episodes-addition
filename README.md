# Introduction

## What this is
This directory and repo are meant to be an external storage destination for pipeline artifacts while testing the addition of episodes to existing pipelines. `./src/` and the respective run_*.py files utilize these artifacts to generate a summary report of the changes between two different pipeline runs. This is intended to improve the ability to easily analyze and summarize the changes that the addition of episodes features had on the pipeline.
